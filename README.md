# CRUDProject
487W Project 2

This wasn't actually the first time I created this project. I had a working one before that was finished the day before the due date. Turns out, Spring Boot can auto generate implementation for methods. This second iteration started its second life at 8 AM on the day that this is due. Who knew I could save this much time and space?
